## Tools Used
- ChatGPT

## How AI Was Used
Chat GPT was used throughout the assignment to help me understand the project requirements and guide me through the development process by breaking it into steps. The AI assisted in creating the project folder structure, explaining how to correctly name and organize files, writing a basic HTML page structure, adding simple CSS styling, and implementing a JavaScript greeting feature based on the time of day. First I referred to the demos and wrote an initial version myself then used AI to point out errors I made.

## Benefits
Using AI helped simplify complex concepts and made the assignment more approachable for me as a beginner. It provided clear explanations, reduced confusion, and helped ensure that the project followed the assignment guidelines correctly.

## Challenges
Some challenges included understanding file naming conventions and knowing where to place certain code elements, such as linking CSS and JavaScript files. These issues were resolved through AI explanations and examples.

## Responsible Use
All AI-generated suggestions were carefully reviewed and adapted. The code was typed manually, modified where needed, and fully understood before being included in the project to ensure academic integrity.

## Learning Outcomes
Through using AI, I learned how to structure a basic web project, link HTML with CSS and JavaScript, use simple conditional logic in JavaScript, and document the development process effectively.
