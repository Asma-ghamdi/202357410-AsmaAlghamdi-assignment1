# Technical Documentation

## Project Overview
This project is a simple personal portfolio website developed as part of Assignment 1. 
The goal of the project is to practice basic web development concepts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the website, including sections such as About Me, Projects, and Contact.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the website, creating layout structure, and ensuring basic responsiveness across different screen sizes.
- **JavaScript**: Used to add interactivity, specifically a greeting message that changes based on the time of day.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into separate folders to improve clarity and maintainability:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the website structure.
- `css/styles.css`: Contains all styling rules for layout, colors, and responsiveness.
- `js/script.js`: Contains JavaScript code for interactive features.
- `assets/images`: Stores project images used in the Projects section.
- `docs`: Contains documentation files, including AI usage and technical documentation.

## Key Features
- A structured portfolio layout with About Me, Projects, and Contact sections.
- A responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes using CSS.
- A JavaScript-based greeting message that changes depending on the current time.
- A contact form for user input (no backend functionality).
